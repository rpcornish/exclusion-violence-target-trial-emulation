# exclusion-violence-target-trial-emulation

The code included here is for a project using target trial emulation to investigate the link between permanent school exclusions and risk of serious violence.

It uses linked data from the National Pupil Database (Department for Education) and the Police National Computer (Ministry of Justice): https://www.adruk.org/data-access/flagship-datasets/ministry-of-justice-department-for-education-linked-dataset-england/
